# Product Context

## Problem Solved

- This application serves as a technical demonstration of Pixi.js capabilities for potential evaluation.

## How It Works

- Users can navigate between different visual scenes using UI elements (e.g., buttons).
- Each scene showcases a specific graphical effect or feature (e.g., particles, text manipulation).

## User Experience Goals

- Smooth transitions between scenes.
- Visually appealing graphics and effects.
- Clear navigation and interaction.

## Problem

The project aims to demonstrate capabilities in building interactive graphical applications with PixiJS, including scene transitions, UI handling, and visual effects like particle systems.

## Solution

Develop a modular application featuring different scenes (e.g., Menu, specific effect demonstrations like 'Phoenix Flame'). Each scene should be self-contained but managed centrally. Implement reusable UI elements and a clear configuration system.

## User Experience

- Smooth transitions between scenes.
- Clear and responsive UI elements.
- Visually appealing graphics and effects.

## Purpose
