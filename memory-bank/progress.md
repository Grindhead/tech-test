# Progress

## What Works

- Scene management structure (`SceneManager`, `BaseScene`).
- Basic UI elements (`Button`).
- Phoenix Flame scene displays:
  - Title text.
  - Back button.
  - Campfire base graphics.
  - Particle emitter for flame effect.
  - Particle count text (with rendering issue).
- Navigation between `MenuScene` and `PhoenixFlameScene`.

## What's Left To Build

- (Based on initial context) Potentially more scenes or effects.
- Refinements to existing scenes.

## Current Status

- Addressing a text rendering bug in `PhoenixFlameScene`.

## Known Issues

- Particle count text in `PhoenixFlameScene` displays incorrectly ("particles + count" instead of "Particles: count").

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initial implementation.
