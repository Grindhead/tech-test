# Project Brief

## Core Requirements

- Create a technical test application showcasing proficiency with Pixi.js.
- Implement several distinct visual scenes/effects.
- Demonstrate good coding practices, including configuration management, scene management, and reusable components.

## Goals

- Build an interactive Pixi.js application with multiple scenes.
- Show understanding of particle effects, text rendering, and basic graphics.
- Create a maintainable and organized codebase.
- Utilize configuration files for easy adjustments.

## Project Goals

1. Demonstrate technical proficiency in game development
2. Showcase clean architecture and code organization
3. Implement responsive and accessible UI components
4. Create smooth, performant animations
5. Handle asset loading and management efficiently
